Are specifications and proofs software?

## Formalization and proof of a classical distributed algorithm

[https://github.com/nano-o/Distributed-termination-detection](https://github.com/nano-o/Distributed-termination-detection)

The algorithm is the "channel-counting" termination-detection algorithm of Kumar (1985).
The proof I propose is a great example of inductive reasoning about distributed algorithms.
The [exercise branch](https://github.com/nano-o/Distributed-termination-detection/tree/exercise) of the repository sets things up as an exercise in finding inductive invariants.
