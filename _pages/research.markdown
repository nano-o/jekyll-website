## Workshops

I sometimes (co-)organize workshops:
* Together with [Swen Jacobs](https://cispa.de/en/people/swen.jacobs/), I am co-organizing the [Workshop on Formal Reasoning in Distributed Algorithms](https://frida-2024.github.io) (FRIDA), which will take place in Montreal on July 23rd.
* In October 2023, [Christian Cachin](https://crypto.unibe.ch/cc/) and myself organized the Workshop on [Heterogeneous Trust in Distributed Systems](https://htds-workshop.github.io/) as part of [AFT 2023](https://aftconf.github.io/aft23/index.html). The recordings are [available on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmr3tp_7-7GjHjTeBSdTu5P15Wde3YMf0).
* Together with [Swen Jacobs](https://cispa.de/en/people/swen.jacobs/), I organized the [2021 Workshop on Formal Reasoning in Distributed Algorithms](https://frida-2021.github.io/). Video recordings are available on Youtube: [Monday's session](https://youtu.be/EzxiDResQUE) and [Friday's session](https://youtu.be/m8ApDWtmB14).
* In 2020, Marijana LaziÄ‡ and myself organized the [2020 Workshop on Formal Reasoning in Distributed Algorithms](https://frida2020.galois.com/) (FRIDA). You can find the videos of the talks on the [QONFEST YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCK9p1Z8nIPTP4Uv5Qodb1og/videos) (search for FRIDA in video titles).
