Hello, my name is Giuliano Losa. Welcome to my research homepage! I am interested in the rigorous design, analysis, and implementation of distributed systems aided by formal methods.

I work at the Stellar Development Foundation, where, with the help of our CTO Nicolas Barry, I started [SDF Research](https://research.stellar.org).

Before that, I worked at [Galois](https://galois.com/), at UCLA (as a postdoc), at Virginia Tech (as a postdoc and briefly as a research assistant professor), at ELCA, Switzerland, as a software engineer, and I obtained a PhD in computer science from EPFL, Switzerland.
