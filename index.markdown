Hello, my name is Giuliano Losa, and I am interested in the rigorous design, analysis, and implementation of distributed systems aided by formal methods.

I work at the Stellar Development Foundation, where, with the help of our CTO Nicolas Barry, I started [SDF Research](https://research.stellar.org).

Before that, in reverse chronological order, I worked at [Galois](https://galois.com/), at UCLA (as a postdoc), at Virginia Tech (as a postdoc and briefly as a research assistant professor), at ELCA, Switzerland, as a software engineer, and I obtained a PhD in computer science from EPFL, Switzerland.

New paper: Giulian Losa (Stellar Development Foundation), Yifan Mao (Ohio State University), Shaileshh Bojja Venkatakrishnan (Ohio State University), and Yunqi Zhang (Ohio State University). Constellation: Peer-to-Peer Overlays for Federated Byzantine Agreement Systems. [FC 2025](https://fc25.ifca.ai/). [Preprint](https://fc25.ifca.ai/preproceedings/280.pdf).


In September, I participated in the Dagstuhl seminar "Next-Generation Secure Distributed Computing" and I gave a talk on verifying liveness of consensus protocols ([Slides](/documents/tla-liveness.pdf) and [specifications](https://github.com/nano-o/tetrabft-tla)) at the [TLA+ Community Event](https://conf.tlapl.us/2024-fm/) in Milan, Italy.

Together with [Swen Jacobs](https://cispa.de/en/people/swen.jacobs/), I am co-organizing the [Workshop on Formal Reasoning in Distributed Algorithms](https://frida-2024.github.io) (FRIDA), which will take place in Montreal on July 23rd.

I am a member of the program committee of the [2024 TLA+ Community Event](https://conf.tlapl.us/2024-fm/), which will take place in Milan on September 10th along with [FM 2024](https://www.fm24.polimi.it/).
